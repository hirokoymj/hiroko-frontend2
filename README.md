## Architecture and coding rules

**Trying to get render function clean and simple**

- Created reuable components with `children` props in React. Button, Dialog and Link are the reusable components and they are used globally in the site.

- Form was built with **React Hook Form** and schema-based form validation called **yup**. I used to use Redux-Form a lot in the site but won't be use any more. React Hook Form is better than Redux-Form because it is simple to use and provides a good documentation.

- Each Form has a Custom Hook function where all necessary form logic such as `onSubmit` is defined. Form usually gets complecated when connecting to back-end API. With Custom Hook, we can separate Form logic from Form UI.

```text
CategoryForm contains UI only.
useCategoryForm hook contains a form logic.
```

**Page Wrapper component**

- Every view page stars with Page Wrappter component called `<PageLayout></PageLayout>`. This makes all view pages keep consisntency functionally and visually.

## APIs

hirokoymj.com is used two external APIs - Weather API and Covid 19 API. I used OpenWeatherMap API in the previous company and it is one of my comfortable apis. For Covid 19 API, I recently added it in my site to show a data visualization and also get to know the daily US covid-19 situation.

**Weather API:**

- [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)

  ```text
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=tokyo&units=metric&appid={id}
  ```

- Implemented the API in GraphQL as datasource

**Covid 19 API**

- [Postman COVID-19 API Resource Center](https://postman-toolboxes.github.io/covid-19/)
